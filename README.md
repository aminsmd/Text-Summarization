# Text-Summarization

> Text summarization is a process of shortening a text document in a way that it contains the main points of the original document.

There are two main approaches in text summarization:
* Extraction: When the sentences of the summary are selected from the original document.
* Abstraction: When the model creates new sentences and forms a summary. Humans summarize documents mostly based on abstractive method.
